# LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS iOS usage example

This repository showcases how to use LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS charting library in a iOS project.

More information about LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS can be found from our website, https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js/.

## Getting Started

The project can be opened with XCode and run on the emulator or an actual device. Refer to the [Apple Developer Guide][0] for instructions for iOS development.

The chart is running inside a [WKWebView][1]. Data is send from the native swift code to the WKWebView to be displayed.
You can find the source code for the charts from `/iOS/assets`. `index.html` is the page that is running inside the WKWebView and contains the JavaScript for configuring the chart.
`lcjs.iife.js` is IIFE packaged version of LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS that can be found inside the NPM package.

JavaScript has to be enabled on iOS device (enabled by default) on the WebView for the chart to work.

### Sending data to the chart

Data can be send to the chart from native Swift code with the help of [evaluateJavaScript][2] method.

```swift
    chart.evaluateJavaScript("setData(\(self.yData), \((self.xData)));") { (any, error) in
        if((error) != nil){ print("Error : \(String(describing: error))")}
    }
```

The `setData` is a JavaScript method that has been defined inside the WKWebView. The `evaluateJavascript` method will call that method to set data in the chart. The contents of `yData` and `xData`  are provided as the arguments to the `setData` method.

```js
  function setData(ySet, xSet){
         if(ySet.length && xSet.length){
             const chartData = xSet.map( ( itr1, itr2 ) => ( { x: itr1, y: ySet[itr2] } ) )
             lineSeries.add(chartData)
         }
     }
```
